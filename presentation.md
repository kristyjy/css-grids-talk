# The basics

## Getting started

Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) to write your slides. Don't be afraid, it's really easy!

--

## Making points

Look how you can make *some* points:
--

- Create slides with your **favorite text editor**
--

- Focus on your **content**, not the tool
--

- You can finally be **productive**!

---

# There's more

## Syntax highlighting

You can also add `code` to your slides:
```html
<div class="impact">Some HTML code</div>
```

## CSS classes

You can use .alt[shortcut] syntax to apply .big[some style!]

...or just <span class="alt">HTML</span> if you prefer.

---

# And more...

## 12-column grid layout

Use to the included **grid layout** classes to split content easily:
.col-6[
  ### Left column

  - I'm on the left
  - It's neat!
]
.col-6[
  ### Right column

  - I'm on the right
  - I love it!
]
